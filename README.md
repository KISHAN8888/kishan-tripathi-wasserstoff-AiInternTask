# PDF Summarization & Keyword Extraction Pipeline

## Overview

This project provides a powerful pipeline for processing PDF documents, generating summaries, and extracting keywords. It's designed for easy setup and use, making it ideal for researchers, data analysts, and anyone dealing with large volumes of PDF documents.

## Features

- üìÑ Multi-threaded PDF processing
- üìù Automatic text summarization
- üîë Intelligent keyword extraction
- üíæ MongoDB integration for data storage
- üìä Performance monitoring

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- MongoDB
- Groq API key (for LLM-based summarization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-summarization-pipeline.git
   cd pdf-summarization-pipeline
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
   ```

### Usage

1. Place your PDF files in the `input_pdfs` folder.

2. Run the pipeline:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. Find processed results in the MongoDB database and performance metrics in `performance_metrics_[timestamp].txt`.
